## Overview 📖

[Turnly](https://turnly.app) helps businesses save their customers time waiting
in physical queues by eliminating legacy number-taking systems.
Customers join from their smart device to a web widget-based system that
can be accessed from your own website or application.

## Features 📦

desks, agents and managers per location.
- **Custom Fields & Processors**: Define custom fields to obtain the necessary information about
a customer to match your internal workflow.

them aware of the life cycle of their tickets.
